## Reporting a Bug

Thank you for improving the security of the Identity product. We appreciate your efforts and
responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your
contributions.

Report security bugs by emailing the lead maintainers at product_security@cyberark.com.

The maintainers will acknowledge your email within 7 business days. Subsequently, we will 
send a more detailed response within 14 business days of our acknowledgement indicating
the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security
team will endeavor to keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full
announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining
the module.

## Disclosure Policy

When the security team receives a security bug report, they will assign it to a
primary handler. This person will coordinate the fix and release process,
involving the following steps:

  * Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
  * Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
  * Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance. These fixes will be
    released as fast as possible.
